# Financial Crawler
A data-mining program that scrapes three different finance web pages, collects various data points, and performes regression, multiples, sentiment, and other analyses using scikit-learn. By providing it with a market index such as the S&P 500 or any industry, this crawler can generate data that can then be used by matplotlib to create visuals, enabling individuals to make more informed decisions about the performance of stocks in the given index or industry.

The code can handle any index, but large indeces will take a long time - stick to indeces under 100 stocks. To run the code you will need to pick an index/category from the following website:
